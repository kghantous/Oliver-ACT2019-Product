            <h2 class="text-center">Perspective</h2>

            <p>After analyzing the pros and cons, I think health in N.P.’s can be hindered by pollution.  One reason this is a problem is b/c it is heavier than air so it is lower to the ground.  According to the N.P.S. website,pollution is made by 1 major source usually factories.  Another reason is OZONE IS VERY HARMFUL.  According to the N.P.S. website,the ozone is a colorless odorless gas that can kill us.   Once again that's why I think health in N.P.’s can be hindered by pollution.</p>
